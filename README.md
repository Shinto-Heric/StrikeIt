# StrikeIt

Developed in C++ using SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and Visual Studio.
This is the revamp of my first game by the same name create in Turbo C++ as part of my school life project.

Play and have fun.

Glitches are there and it will be fixed later.
Now I'm trying to improve the UX more better.
